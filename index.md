## Professional Self Assessment
During my time at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My experience with SNHU has taught me a great deal about the development of software. Not only have I learned the technical coding skills, but also the interpersonal skills required for the software development lifecycle. In every course at SNHU, I collaborated with other students during weekly discussions. In CS250, I learned about the software development lifecycle and participated in an agile sprint. In CS 255, I learned how to analyze requirements from stakeholders to design systems, creating documents for both the stakeholders and the development team. The coursework for CS 319 included holding interviews with potential users of an application, incorporating their feedback on prototypes into a finalized design. Throughout my time at SNHU, I have learned how to tailor my communication for stakeholders, colleagues, peers, and users.

I have also gained valuable technical skills through my coursework. I have developed projects in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I created desktop software, android applications, embedded software, and full stack web applications. These projects have taught me skills such as object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, data structures and algorithms, unit testing, and working with frameworks. I have had to design and develop my own programs, as well as debug code written by others. Several times, the coursework contained code that had been depreciated. I learned to refactor the code I was given so it would run before adding the code I was required to write for the assignment. This experience has strengthened my ability to debug and fix errors.

Several of the courses I took at SNHU were related to databases. I gained skills in both SQL and NoSQL databases. In DAD220, I learned SQL and created complex queries for a MySQL database. I used SQLite for an Android application I developed in CS 360. The NoSQL database I have experience with is MongoDB. This was used in both CS 340 and CS 465 as the database for a web application. 

Secure coding was another important skill that I gained from SNHU. I learned how to prevent SQL injection through the use of parameterized inputs. I practiced input validation and preventing buffer overflow. I performed code analyses checking for vulnerabilities, employing both static and unit testing. I learned about encryption algorithms, and the tradeoffs when selecting an algorithm. I also learned secure coding design concepts, such as not leaving security until the end, defense in depth, and the principle of least privilege. 

The artifacts below showcase my talents as a software developer. They consist of three original projects created during my time at SNHU, and three enhancements made to these projects. The first artifact demonstrates my software design and engineering skills. The second exhibits my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. The final artifact is related to databases. All three enhancements are written in Java.
